# T20 World Cup Data Analytics Project

## Objective  
To perform end-to-end data analytics on T20 World Cup matches by collecting, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing key match statistics. The goal is to derive meaningful insights using Power BI dashboards for better understanding of players' performance, team comparisons, and match outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- Python: Data cleaning, transformation, and CSV generation using Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing  
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation and data visualization  

## Key Highlights  
- Collected raw T20 match data in JSON format and transformed it into structured CSV files using Python 
- Performed data cleaning (removal of duplicates, column formatting, null handling) in both Python and Power BI  
- Created calculated columns and DAX measures (e.g., Strike Rate, Boundary %, Dot Ball %) to support deep analysis  
- Developed multiple interactive dashboards with slicers, buttons, clean layout, and custom visuals  
- Analyzed player and team performance, match trends, top scorers, match-winning contributions, and more   

## Sample Power BI Dashboards  
Here are some sample visuals from the project:
